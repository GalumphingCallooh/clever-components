# ADR 0011: Sorting CSS declarations

Since we started this project, we tried to apply an alphabetical sort on CSS declarations inside our LitElement based components.
We did it manually and of course we failed in some places so it's time to automate this...

TODO:

* Explain why we want to sort declarations
* Explain how we failed with raw babel
* Explain how an ESLint rule with fix works better
* Introduce postcss (and sync/async stuffs)
* Explain how https://github.com/Siilwyn/css-declaration-sorter failed
* Explain how https://github.com/hudochenkov/postcss-sorting works

QUESTIONS:
